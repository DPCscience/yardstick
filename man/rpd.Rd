\usage{
rpd(data, ...)

\method{rpd}{data.frame}(data, truth, estimate, na.rm = TRUE, ...)

rpd_vec(truth, estimate, na.rm = TRUE, ...)

rpiq(data, ...)

\method{rpiq}{data.frame}(data, truth, estimate, na.rm = TRUE, ...)

rpiq_vec(truth, estimate, na.rm = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} containing the \code{truth} and \code{estimate}
columns.}

\item{...}{Not currently used.}

\item{truth}{The column identifier for the true results
(that is \code{numeric}). This should be an unquoted column name although
this argument is passed by expression and supports
\link[rlang:quasiquotation]{quasiquotation} (you can unquote column
names). For \code{_vec()} functions, a \code{numeric} vector.}

\item{estimate}{The column identifier for the predicted
results (that is also \code{numeric}). As with \code{truth} this can be
specified different ways but the primary method is to use an
unquoted variable name. For \code{_vec()} functions, a \code{numeric} vector.}

\item{na.rm}{A \code{logical} value indicating whether \code{NA}
values should be stripped before the computation proceeds.}
}
\value{
For \code{_vec()} functions, a single \code{numeric} value (or \code{NA}).
Otherwise, a \code{tibble} with columns \code{.metric}, \code{.estimator},
and \code{.estimate} and 1 row of values. For grouped data frames, the number
of rows returned will be the same as the number of groups.
}
\description{
These functions are appropriate for cases where the model
outcome is a number. The ratio of performance to deviation
(\code{rpd()}) and the ratio of performance to inter-quartile (\code{rpiq()})
are both measures of consistency/correlation between observed
and predicted values (and not of accuracy).
}
\details{
In the field of spectroscopy in particular, the ratio
of performance to deviation (RPD) has been used as the standard
way to report the quality of a model. It is the ratio between
the standard deviation of a variable and the standard error of
prediction of that variable by a given model. However, its
systematic use has been criticized by several authors, since
using the standard deviation to represent the spread of a
variable can be misleading on skewed dataset. The ratio of
performance to inter-quartile has been introduced by
Bellon-Maurel et al. (2010) to address some of these issues, and
generalise the RPD to non-normally distributed variables.
