# yardstick 0.0.2

* The expectation for table data has changed. As of this version, the true values are expected to be in the _rows_ of the table ([issue #17](https://github.com/topepo/yardstick/issues/17)). While there is no standard, this is consistent with `caret` and other packages. This affects `conf_mat`, `sens`, and other functions that can take tables as imputs. 


# yardstick 0.0.1

* First CRAN release
